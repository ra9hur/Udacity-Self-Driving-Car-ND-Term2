# Udacity-Self-Driving-Car-ND-Term 2
To build the core robotic functions of an autonomous vehicle system: sensor fusion, localization and control. All projects are implemented using C++ as programming language.

GitHub repository links to Term 2 projects are as given below.

## Projects

-------------

**1. Bi-cycle Tracking using Extended Kalman Filters (EKF)**

Simulated lidar and radar measurements are provided to detect a bicycle that travels around the vehicle. EKF implementation uses the method called first order Taylor expansion to obtain linear approximation of the non-linear systems. 

Here is the link for the completed project - [SDC-P6-Extended-Kalman-Filter][1]

**2. Bi-cycle Tracking using Unscented Kalman Filters (UKF)**

As in project 1, simulated lidar and radar measurements are provided to detect a bicycle that travels around the vehicle. The Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) is a novel development in the field. UKF implementation locates objects with better accuracy in highly non-linear systems.

**3. Kidnapped Vehicle**

Implement a particle filter to take real-world data and localize a lost vehicle. < yet to be implemented >

-------------

**4. Lane Keeping - PID Controller Project**

Implement a PID Controller to race around the lake track and to keep a simulated vehicle in its lane. For an extra challenge, use computer vision techniques to identify the lane lines and estimate the cross-track error. < yet to be implemented >

-------------

**5. Model Predictive Control**

Implement a sophisticated control algorithm for stabilizing the vehicle in a noisy environment. < yet to be implemented >
