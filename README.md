# Udacity-Self-Driving-Car-ND-Term 2
To build the core robotic functions of an autonomous vehicle system: sensor fusion, localization and control.

**Projects**

**1. Extended Kalman Filters in C++**
Extended Kalman filters are used by autonomous vehicle engineers to combine measurements from multiple sensors into a non-linear model. < yet to be implemented >

**2. Pedestrian Tracking**
Fuse noisy lidar and radar data together to track a pedestrian. < yet to be implemented >

**3. Kidnapped Vehicle**
Implement a particle filter to take real-world data and localize a lost vehicle. < yet to be implemented >

**4. Lane-Keeping**
Implement a controller to keep a simulated vehicle in its lane. For an extra challenge, use computer vision techniques to identify the lane lines and estimate the cross-track error. < yet to be implemented >
